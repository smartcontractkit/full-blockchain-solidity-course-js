# Error: ERROR processing C:\Users\HP\smartcontract-lottery\deploy\01-deploy-raffle.js: Error: incorrect data length (argument="gaslane", value={"type":"BigNumber","hex":"0x2386f26fc10000"}, code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=abi/5.6.4) #866


The gasLimit value is a property of a transaction object that specifies the maximum amount of gas that can be used for executing the transaction. It's possible that the gasLimit value provided in the script is too large or too small, resulting in the error.

One potential solution is to check the gasLimit value being passed to the contract deployment function and ensure that it is a valid integer value. You can also try to increase the gasLimit value slightly to see if that resolves the error.

Another possibility is that there is an issue with the version of the ABI library being used. You may want to check if there is an updated version of the library available and update it if necessary.
