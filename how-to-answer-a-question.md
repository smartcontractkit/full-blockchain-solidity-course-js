# How to answer questions

Thank you for wanting to answer questions! This is how we grow as a community :)

1. Make sure the question follows the "how-to-ask-a-good-question" guide
2. Make sure your answer unblocks the user
3. Remember, this is living documentation!
4. Format your answers, like in the `how-to-ask-a-question` guide.

# 1. Make sure the question follows the "how-to-ask-a-good-question" guide

If the question is poorly formatted and you know how to reformat it, then go ahead and reformat it. Then, politely ask the person to format their code properly in future questions.

If a question is posted in the wrong place, such as a theoretical question posted on Stack Overflow, please kindly inform the poster that it's in the wrong place.

If a question has already been asked and answered, please provide a link to the original question and answer, and ask if that solves the problem.

If a question has a poor title or doesn't make sense to others, feel free to edit it to something that you can understand. If you cannot understand it, you can answer by saying, "I don't quite understand what you're asking. Could you reformat your question following the 'how to ask a question' guide?"

If the question includes screenshots, kindly ask them to provide the code in a copy-pasteable format.

However, it's also okay to ignore it. This is a community-run forum, and no one is "entitled to" answers. Please remember to be respectful and nice to others. If you do know how to help someone, a little "could you please reformat your question" can go a long way!

### If someone is not asking a well-formatted question, don't feel obliged to help them right away. Encourage them to ask a well-formatted question first before answering

However, please remember to be respectful and polite when doing so. If their question just needs a little formatting touch-up, you can kindly touch up their question for them.

# 2. Ensure your answer helps them

Sometimes, people ask questions where they might be trying to do something different than what they're asking. In such cases, try to anticipate what they're trying to achieve. Answer the question at face value and then provide additional information on where to go next.

It's often helpful to provide a summary of your answer at the top along with copy-pasteable code. You can also add a "more information" section to your answer to provide additional details.

# 3. Remember this is living documentation!

Keep in mind that this documentation is dynamic!
Treat it as a living document and revisit your answers to update them as needed."

# 4. Format your answers, like in the `how-to-ask-a-question` guide.

See that guide for more information.
